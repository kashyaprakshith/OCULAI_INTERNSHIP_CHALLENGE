video used : Concreting

I'm going with background subtraction which only focuses on foreground, and using this I thought it could be one of the methods to track the progress of construction. 
please use the video uploaded and change the path accordingly to check the results of my code. i have also posted the photos of first frames and also of a a frame after few seconds where the results are properlyy visible 
 ## image 1 : This image represents the first frame
