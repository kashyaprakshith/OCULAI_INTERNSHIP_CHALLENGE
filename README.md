video used : Concreting

I'm going with background subtraction which only focuses on foreground, and using this I thought it could be one of the methods to track the progress of construction. 
please use the videos in the data folder to check the results of my code. i have also posted the photos of first frames and also of a a frame after few seconds where the results are properlyy visible 
 ## image 1 : This image represents the first frame
